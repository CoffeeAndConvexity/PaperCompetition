\section{Other utilities}

\paragraph{Stochastic optimization for general $v_i$.}
When $v_i$ are general (measurable) valuations on $\Theta$, the convex program \eqref{eq:eg-dual-beta-1} can be reformulated and solved using a first-order stochastic optimization method, such as dual averaging \citep{nesterov2009primal,xiao2010dual}. 

\paragraph{Quasilinear utilities.}
For quasilinear buyer utilities, similar to the developments in \S\ref{sec:equi-and-dual}, we can extend the corresponding EG-type equilibrium-capturing convex programs (see, e.g., \cite[\S Lemma 3]{cole2017convex}) for finitely many items to the infinite case.
