All modifications made with proper rephrasing / removal of other references, with or without \ref, \eqref.

* Removed stochastic optimization and QL (but added a few lines in the intro). 

* Removed bounds on equilibrium beta (since we omit stochastic optimization details).

* Removed some examples. 

* Removed more details on the experiments in the appendix.

* Moved many \[...\] equations inline.
